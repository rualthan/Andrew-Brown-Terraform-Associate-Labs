These are the codes from the follow alongs of Andrew Brown's HashiCorp Terraform Associate (003) course. 

The full course is available on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoGoo1n1NWE&list=PLBfufR7vyJJ6OmMNbvfkBx1HcL-XI8ymgexa) as well on [ExamPro](https://www.exampro.co/) for free.

Andrew's shared the codes on this [repository](https://github.com/ExamProCo/Terraform-Associate-Labs). You can clone it but I wanted to write from scratch as I followed along.
